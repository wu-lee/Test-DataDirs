=head1 NAME

Test::DataDirs - manage t/data and t/temp directories for your tests

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class is a convenience which provides data directories from which
to source information for your tests, and temp directories you can
write data.

Declare some temp and data directories you need in your test script as
below.  These are implicitly relative to C<< t/temp/<yourscriptname> >>
 and C<< t/data/<yourscriptname> >>.  Then you may refer to them
using the appropriate entry in the returned hash and assume the dirs
exist and that the temp dirs have been (re-)created.

    # File: t/test-01.t
    use Test::DataDirs;

    my %D = Test::DataDirs->new(
        temp => [temp_stuff => 'actual-dir',
                 more_temp  => 'another-dir'],
        data => [data_stuff => 'actual-dir'],
    )->hash;

    print "My test data is checked into $D{data_stuff}\n"
    print "below $D{data_dir}\n"
    # Prints (except with absolute paths):
    # My test data is checked into t/data/test-01/actual-dir
    # below t/data/test-01

    print "I can write temp data into $D{temp_stuff}\n"
    print "and $D{more_temp}, "below $D{temp_dir}\n"
    # Prints (except with absolute paths):
    # I can write temp data into t/temp/test-01/actual-dir
    # and t/temp/test-01/another-dir below t/data/test-01


This module defines an OO interface.  See also
L<Test::DataDirs::Exporter> for a module with similar usage but which
imports vars into your namespace.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 C<< $obj = $class->new(%params) >>

Given parameters including:

  base => $base_dir,

  data => [ddir1 => relpath3, ddir2 => relpath4 ...]

  temp => [tdir1 => relpath1, tdir2 => relpath2 ...]

Uses C<base> as a base dir in which to find data dirs C<relpathN> (which
are checked to exist), and in which to re-create fresh test dirs
C<relpathM>.

If C<base> is not given, uses the name of the invoking script, with
any leading digits or periods stripped, and any trailing ".t"
stripped.

Retuns a hash-based object which keys the names C<ddirN> and C<tdirN>
to the appropriate paths constructed from C<$base_dir> and the
appropriate C<relpath>.
